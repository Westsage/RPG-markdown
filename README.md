# RPG Markdown

> ! November 2020, I'm bringing this to life again!

RPG Markdown is an effort to create structured guidelines for writing game content. The goal is readable, easy to write and parsable for extraction of data to game entities.

RPG Markdown is based on patterns commonly used in TTRPG game texts.

RPG Markdown recomends patterns that a writer should follow to allow parser to extract game data from a text.

Consider RPG Markdown a dialect of standard markdown.

## Some uses for RPG Markdown

- Create source material for games and stories.
- Structure a plot.
- Save transcripts of dialogs and game session activity.
- Write manuscripts for plays, LARPs or NPC dialog in an adventure.
- Extract data about a game enteties for use in bots, virtual tabletops, scripts and macros.

## RPG Markdown should

- Render well in regular markdown parsers.
- Read well in Markdown editor.
- Have syntax that is recognisable to cretors of TTRPG game content.

## The foundation

RPG Markdown is a based on [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) language by John GrÃ¼ber.

To allow for writing of dialogs RPG Markdown uses the Markdown dialect [Fountain](http://fountain.io/) which allows for writing of screenplays.

It also suggests how to use Front Matter to enrich the markdown content.

And many more that I haven't mentioned yet. I'll keep adding.

## The parser

The first parser was built as an extension of [Dominic Baggotts markdown parser](https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js) which renders to both HTML and JSON. The JSON part is the result of the syntax differientals which tags certain content as data.

> 2020-11-19, I just started work on rebuilding the parser to work with the [Unified Collective](https://unifiedjs.com/) and especially the markdown parser [Remark](https://remark.js.org/). One goal is to structure RPG Markdown as an [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree)

## Current status

2021-01-21, RPG Markdown is to some extent used in the character sheet module for [FictionBoard Actor Module](https://app.fictionboard.com/actors)

2020-11-29, The RPG Markdown concept is being used in my virtual tabletop project [FictionBoard](https://www.fictionboard.com). It's still in an early phase of development and I just restarted work on the parser and dialect specification.
