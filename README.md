# Purpose of RPG Markdown

RPG Markdown is an effort to create a markup language for writing game content. It should be easy to write and read, transform well
to pdfs and other text formats and handle storyline elements and flow.

**We'll use RPG Markdown to**

- write campaign material such as adventures, world and location descriptions, scenes
- extract data and action points from flowing text (Stats from an NPC, skill checks in an adventure scene).
- allow writeups of dialogs, session transcripts, manuscripts for LARPs or NPC dialog in an adventure.
- create templates for use with auto-insert macros
- write blog posts
- allow for greater chat functionality

**RPG Markdown should**

- render well in a regular markdown parser
- be system agnostic
- easily transform from existing text formats
- work independently of FictionBoard

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is just plain text with markup that enables you as a reader to understand the purpose of each text element. The markup is easily rendered to HTML, PDFs or other text formats. Markdown is very lightweight since it's just plain text.

Consider this example
- - -

\# I'm a heading

I am just plain text but this \_word_ is italic. I want to \*\*make this stand out**.

\- this is a list item

\- and another list item

\## This is a sub heading (Note the two hashes)

Oh, I want to include \[A link to a site](http://link.to/a_site) 

- - -

or this

- - - 

MARK THE DWARF

"No way we're doing THAT"

ELVIN

"I just said we could toss you"

MARK THE DWARF

\_sighs_
"No other suggestions?"

GNORK THE BARBARIAN

grabs the little dwarf by the feet
"Time to toss!!"

- - -

**It's really easy to write!**

The second thing could be a writeup of a dialog, an actual chat transcribt or even a play.


You do not need a specific editor to write Markdown, notepad or similar will do.


## Buildt on solid foundation

For this markup language to rest on a solid ground we've based it on the widely used [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) language by John Gr√ºber.

To allow for writing of dialogs RPG Markdown uses the Markdown dialect [Fountain](http://fountain.io/) which allows for writing of screenplays.

We're also using [PHP Markdown Extra](http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/) to allow such things as footnotes and defenition lists.

And - there are probably several other sources of inspiration I haven't mentioned yet but they'll recieve their credits when we get to the first release.

### Other Markdown inspiration

- [Maruku](http://maruku.rubyforge.org/maruku.html)
- [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/)
- [Pandocs Markdown](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#pandocs-markdown)

## The parser

In development we've buildt an extension of [Dominic Baggotts markdown parser](https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js) which renders to both HTML and JSON.

The JSON part is the result of the syntax differientals which tags certain content as data.

## Current status

RPG Markdown is still in the works and a very young project. As it is being used in our project "FictionBoard" we will probably release the full spec at the time of its beta release.
